The Gulp Automator is a quick task in implementation, simple to use and easy to learn. It uses as a base the node.js platform to interpret your code and requires Javascript knowledge to create their work.

These tasks can be anything you need to do repeatedly or that will consume much of your time. For example, minificar image, copy directories, concatenate files, compile Javascript etc. All these are tasks that, if done manually, will consume much time and labor; and Gulp takes care of it all.


# Gulp characteristics 

* Easy to use: With simple installation and a few lines of code, you run labor-intensive processes with only a command line.
* Efficient: Enjoy Stream technology Node.js, without building intermediate files on disk and uses the pipeline mechanism unix.
* Easy to learn: Basically knowing a little about the pipeline mechanism unix, Javascript and understanding the structure of gulpfile that is simple, you are ready to create jobs.
